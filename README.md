# MY BLOG APP

The application allows users to read blog posts, login or signup to like a post, and for staff/admin to manage posts and users. If you have a passion for writing and sharing your thoughts, this app is for you.

While the code may not be perfect and may still contain bugs, the goal is to provide a practical, hands-on experience in building a real-world application. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome.
